# Open Reality Tabs

### This needs a similar write up to the exokit engine user doc too but more targeted just for Exokit Browser with pictures.

(could use the following copy/paste from old Apps tabs section)
## Install Exokit Browser

1. Visit [get.webmr.io](https://get.webmr.io/) to download Exokit Browser.         

2. Run the downloaded file, and be sure to allow any security clearance the installer might need.
	* (For Linux: `apt-get install build-essential wget python libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev uuid-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libasound2-dev libexpat1-dev`)

3. Then let the installer work its magic for a minute or so and congratulations you're (almost) a proud user of Exokit Browser!
	* For Windows Users:
		* Choose your desired folder location (note: if not installing into your main drive then you may have to go into the folder yourself after downloading and find the file 'exokit.cmd')
	* For OSX Users:
		* A window should open with the Exokit Browser app file and your applications folder, simply drag Exokit Browser into that folder.	
	* For Linux Users:
		* If you used the install script all of the above should be in /usr/lib (which is probably in your PATH).

# Controls

Of course being that Exokit Browser is not limited to one platform, we thought it would be a good idea to not leave you in the dark when it comes to how to actually use the thing we have been making all this time, so below are a few notes on controls that we thought might be useful to you.

* When on a "non-VR only" (e.g. Magic Leap) form of entering Exokit Browser, you will not be immediately loaded into VR. Go ahead and hit enter VR with the `i` key, enter VR on a Magic Leap with the `o` key.

* When on a Desktop platform of any kind you should be able to simply click once to enter the home environment or loaded site if it does not immediately react to your mouse/keyboard.

* For Menu Access (the homepage environment interaction display), "E" opens menu if using a keyboard, with a HTC Vive, accessing the menu comes by hitting the menu button ABOVE the thumb trackpad.
