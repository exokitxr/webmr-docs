## Open Reality Tabs

This needs a similar write up to the exokit engine user doc too but more targeted just for Exokit Browser with pictures.

## Controls

Of course being that Exokit Browser is not limited to one platform, we thought it would be a good idea to not leave you in the dark when it comes to how to actually use the thing we have been making all this time, so below are a few notes on controls that we thought might be useful to you.

* When on a "non-VR only" (e.g. Magic Leap) form of entering Exokit Browser, you will not be immediately loaded into VR. Go ahead and hit enter VR with the `i` key, enter VR on a Magic Leap with the `o` key.

* When on a Desktop platform of any kind you should be able to simply click once to enter the home environment or loaded site if it does not immediately react to your mouse/keyboard.

* For Menu Access (the homepage environment interaction display), "E" opens menu if using a keyboard, with a HTC Vive, accessing the menu comes by hitting the menu button ABOVE the thumb trackpad.
