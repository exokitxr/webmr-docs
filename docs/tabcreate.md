### Reality Tabs are a new way to think about distributing and consuming VR/AR content.

Exokit offers the technology to hot swap through VR/AR experiences on the fly.<br>

## Reality tabs ~= Web Browser Tabs... but for VR/AR

It is basically the same user experience as using a normal web browser that we are all used
to. Reality Tabs are akin to normal browser tabs, except that you are truly in the tab.

You can create your own Reality Tab easily by hosting your VR/AR web app on a valid domain. Exokit handles the rendering of the Reality Tab and brings it into the users view for you.
