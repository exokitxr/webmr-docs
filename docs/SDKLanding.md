- Exokit is trying to actually be as close to the current web APIs as possible to allow for an easier transition for current web devs.

- We will also be mirroring as many existing API styles rather than inventing new ones. For example, the tabs capture API from mozilla here.

- The stuff that doesn't exist on the web yet, like Magic Leap + Leap Motion, is going to be heavily inspired by WebXR.
