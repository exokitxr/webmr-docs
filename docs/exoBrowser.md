Exokit Browser is inherently multi-platform since it's just Javascript and C++ bindings to libraries. It binds to Vive, Oculus, Leap Motion, Magic Leap, and keyboard/mouse on Windows, OSX, or Linux.
  
 The main interface is "Reality Tabs", or opening 3D web sites as layers of virtual/augmented reality. The product runs on web content and standards (HTML, WebXR, WebGL, Unity + Unreal exports). Exokit Engine is the fastest on the market (2-3x faster than Chrome or Firefox) in performance and to adapting to the extremely fast pace of change in the world of mixed reality.
