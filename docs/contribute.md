### If you know code:

  * If you know JS: Either dive into the code ("the browser is a site"), pick up an issue marked [good first issue](https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), or [ask us](support.md).  

### If you don't know code:

  * For non-code contributions: File a good bug report with information to reproduce the bug for your site, or tell us about your use case that you'd like to work (filing an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit/issues/new) is a great way to do that).
