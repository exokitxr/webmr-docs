# How to Contribute

### If you know code:

  * If you know JS: Either dive into the code ("the browser is a site"), pick up an issue marked good first issue, or ask us.  

### If you dont know code:

  * For non-code contributions: File a good bug report with a repro for your site, or tell us about your use case that you'd like to work (filing an issue on the [github](https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit) is a great way to do that).
