# Before You Begin
Things to Be Sure You Have

- A VR-capable GPU, since you're dealing with VR-style sites.

- If applicable, a headset supported by OpenVR really helps with testing your code. Most headsets on the market will do the trick.

- Broadband internet, which means it passes the Youtube HD test, it's not a high requirement but also not universal, so just be sure that you know what you are working with.

- Windows/OSX/Linux as an OS. Currently only Windows does VR, OSX coming soon, and Linux after that!

- If you're embedding exokit in another app, node 10+ will be required.

- And since you'll be coding, a text editor(aka IDE) to make your vision a virtual reality.
