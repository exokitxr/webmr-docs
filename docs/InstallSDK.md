# Installing the SDK
- The Exokit SDK is currently in development, check out any progress here, we stream daily!

- Instead of SDK it would probably be more like a boilerplate repo, plus tutorial videos that we will be making.

- You don't really need anything except exokit itself to start, but we know people like to start with an example site + server script. This is a 1.0-level feature that we will be working on soon as time allows.
