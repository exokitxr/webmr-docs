# Other Features and Libraries
- The best part of Exokit when it comes to this is that it's regular web API's, there isn't too much outside research you have to do in order to start coding for Exokit.

- However, we recommend using either THREE.js, Aframe, React 360, or even another full engine that can compile to web, such as Unity, as a side note we do support WebASM as well.

- We also have added some extra API's to do things other browsers can't, e.g. for Magic Leap, Leap Motion, UDP, and multiplayer, and more in the future.
