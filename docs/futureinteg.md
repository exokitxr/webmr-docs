# Integrations
  
  As it stands the current objectives for what we hope to integrate going forward are the following;
  
  * Electron: We know people want to use Exokit on top of their existing Electron app to leverage the performance and hackability, so this is definitely up there on the order in which these are being worked on.
  
  * ETH: This is another thing that we've experimented with for a while, and we're intrested in blockchain possibility. While we don't want exokit to become a vehicle for token speculation, we think there could be a place for some sort of subscription model or notion of app ownership in alliance with crypto use. This isn't strictly about Ethereum but blockchains in general.
  
  * ARCore + ARKit: We would love to have the Exokit core run on these, taking in matrices from the phone and working with any WebXR/Exokit content is a big step to take and we are all about it. We've run experiments with both so far so its definitely in the cards. ARCore is much easier than ARKit because Apple isn't very flexible here (no dynarec, no V8). But either way this would not be a new Exokit, it would be the same Exokit so whatever content runs today would just automagically run on the phone. Like tabletop Emukit. Also applies to Daydream/VR for these devices.
  
  * And most recently, with our newest addition of Emukit (our VR-based Console Emulator), we hope to support consoles and emulators as well.
