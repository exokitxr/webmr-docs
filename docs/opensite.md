# Opening Websites and Examples

* When you run "Exokit Browser" a command prompt and a larger window will open, turn your attention to the larger window. In the window you will see a VR keyboard for our VR users (or legacy if you have time to kill), and our Home enviroment navigation menu.
* If you navigate to "Apps" you'll see a list of approved VR links from our [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exokit/). Go ahead and enter any VR website URL, or point-and-click on any of the sites on the populated list.
* You can also run "Exokit Command Prompt" and get to sites from there (see "Exokits Command Prompt" below).

## Exokit's Command Prompt

The Exokit command prompt is a NodeJS REPL. If you're a node developer, the interface should be quite familiar. Open Exokit Command Prompt and run the command, `.help` :

To get to links from the command prompt itself, punch in the command: `.go`, then simply put in your desired URL and hit enter.
