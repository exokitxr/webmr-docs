## XRMultiplayer

XRMultiplayer is an experimental API and protocol for multi-user presence that compliments WebXR. It is a client-server protocol for lightweight sharing of user "parties" and scenes.

For more info, you can read the code on the [webmixedreality/xrmp](https://github.com/webmixedreality/xrmp) GitHub repository.
