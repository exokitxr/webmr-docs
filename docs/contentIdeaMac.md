# OSX Startup
### Exokit Installation:

- Head to our latest installer releases here.

- Navigate to the "exokit-macos-x64.dmg" file on the list of the most recent version of Exokit.

- Run the .dmg download, and be sure to allow any security clearance the installer might need.

- A window should open with the Exokit app file and your applications folder, simply drag exokit into that folder.

- You should now be able to search for and run exokit in your applications folder, hurray! Go ahead and start it up and it will load up a window to the home environment.

- From there you can see our featured links to VR websites or input your own with the keyboard floating in front of you! Feel free to use your real world keyboards as well for it.
