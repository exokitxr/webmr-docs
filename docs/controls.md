# Controls

Of course being that Exokit is not limited to one platform, we thought it would be a good idea to not leave you in the dark when it comes to how to actually use the thing we have been making all this time, so below are a few notes on controls that we thought might be useful to you.

* When on a "non-VR only" (e.g. Magic Leap) form of entering Exokit, you will not be immediatly loaded into VR. Go ahead and hit enter VR with the `i` key, enter VR on a Magic Leap with the `o` key.
* When on a Desktop platform of any kind you should be able to simply click once to enter the home enviroment or loaded site if it does not immediatly react to your mouse/keyboard.
* For Menu Access (the homepage environment interaction display), "E" opens menu if using a keyboard, with a HTC Vive, accessing the menu comes by hitting the menu button ABOVE the thumb trackpad.
