# Download and Build

1. Be sure to grab a download for your OS [here](https://get.webmr.io/)
2. Run the downloaded file, and be sure to allow any security clearance the installer might need.
(For Linux: `apt-get install build-essential wget python libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev uuid-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libasound2-dev libexpat1-dev` to run the build, we recommend this for devs.)
3. Then let the installer work its magic for a minute or so and congratulations you're (almost) a proud user of Exokit!

 * For PC Users: Choose your desired folder location (note: if not installing into your main drive then you may have to go into the folder yourself after download and find a file called 'exokit' which will be a windows command prompt)
 * For OSX Users: A window should open with the Exokit app file and your applications folder, simply drag Exokit into that folder.
 * For Linux Users: All of the above should be in `/usr/lib` (which is probably in your PATH) once the script is done, go ahead and `curl https://get.webmr.io/linux`(or wget) for further instructions.
  
4. Go ahead and find/start the program `Exokit Browser`, and run it.
5. Now you are ready to start checking out sites and seeing what Exokit can do.
