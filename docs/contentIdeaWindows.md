# Windows Startup
### Exokit Installation:

- Head to our latest installer releases here

- Navigate to the "exokit-win-x64.exe" file on the list of the most recent version of Exokit

- Run the .exe download, and be sure to allow any security clearance the installer might need.

- Choose your desired folder location (note: if not installing into your main drive (C Drive for most) then you may have to go into the folder yourself after and find a file called 'exokit' which will be a windows command prompt)

- Then let the installer work its magic for a minute or so and congratulations you're a proud user of Exokit! :D

- To open it up head over to your start menu or search bar down there and type in 'exokit', you should see the 'Exokit Browser' come up, go ahead and hit it and it will load up a window to the home environment.

- From there you can see our featured links to VR websites or input your own with the keyboard floating in front of you! Feel free to use your real world (lame) keyboards as well for it.
