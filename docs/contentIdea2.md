## Explain the Exokit browser in it's relation to Exokit Engine and the differences.

## Explain what you can do inside the Exokit browser, maybe a short tutorial? 

## Loading Apps.. 

## Opening Websites and Examples

* When you run "Exokit Browser" a command prompt and a larger window will open, turn your attention to the larger window. In the window you will see a VR keyboard for our VR users (or legacy if you have time to kill), and our Home environment navigation menu.

* If you navigate to "Apps" you'll see a list of approved VR links from our [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/exokit/). Go ahead and enter any VR website URL, or point-and-click on any of the sites on the populated list.

* You can also run ["Exokit Command Prompt"](#exokit-s-command-prompt)  and get to sites from there.

**Controls**

* When on a "non-VR only" (e.g. Magic Leap) form of entering Exokit Browser, you will not be immediately loaded into VR. Go ahead and hit enter VR with the `i` key, enter VR on a Magic Leap with the `o` key.

* For Menu Access (the homepage URL bar and keyboard), "E" opens menu if using a keyboard, with a HTC Vive, accessing the menu comes by hitting the menu button **above** the thumb track-pad.

## Examples

Let's open a ThreeJS website in Exokit Browser.

Go to the ThreeJS [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) page using your web browser of choice (for now).

These ThreeJS examples will run in Exokit Engine and  the Browser, so lets get into it. Let's try the first one, [animation/cloth](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth). Observe that this is a WebGL site, and that it renders fine in Chrome:

Now we're going to open this same site using Exokit Browser.

1. Open your Exokit Browser:

![three.js](https://i.imgur.com/ISM7VwI.png)

2. Then simply paste (Command-V) or type the link of the example into the URL bar:

3. Go ahead and hit enter (in VR or on your own keyboard), and the example should load up:

## Exokit Engine's Command Prompt

Open Exokit Engine Command Prompt and run the command, `.help`

To get to links from the command prompt itself, punch in the command: `.go`, then simply put in your desired URL.
