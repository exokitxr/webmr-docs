 The Exokit Engine is made from the ground-up for performance and ease of access in the post-screen era. 
  
  ## How?
  
  We achieve this by not being based on legacy like Chrome and Firefox, which have slow load times and are difficult to create experiences on. Exokit Engine can run web mixed reality experiences faster than any other browser's engine currently.
   
 We have done this by making the engine from first principles. We didn't start with a 2d browser then slap some half assed VR into it. The team considered what a runtime for VR would look like on a web stack... and then we did that. The Exokit Engine is inherently multi-platform as it binds to Vive, Oculus, Leap Motion, Magic Leap, and keyboard/mouse on Windows, OSX, or Linux. The experience is pervasively multi-player; every experience can be shared.
  
 The main interface is "Reality Tabs", or opening 3D web sites as layers of virtual/augmented reality. The product runs on web content and standards (HTML, WebXR, WebGL, Unity + Unreal exports). Exokit Engine is the fastest on the market (2-3x faster than Chrome or Firefox) in performance and to adapting to the extremely fast pace of change in the world of mixed reality.  
  
  ## Who is Using This Thing?
  
  Users get the benefits of free, persistent, multi-user content experience on the web at a low switching cost with plenty of entertainment and social opportunities. Developers of the platform get value from costless customer outreach to very large engine/device matrix with ease of integration (Unity, Unreal, web) with standard web APIs and future planned hosting products and payments platform. 

  ## Why Another VR/AR Engine?
  
  We realize that between the big ones now, there is a lot of comfort in knowing Chrome and Firefox are at the top and there is a lot to be said about the progress that they have brought to the web browsing field. However, at this point moving forward for them into new fields and platforms is like towing a glacier with a car and rope, it takes too long and leaves people wanting.
   
  With new innovations in web development, VR, and MR (e.g. Magic Leap, Leap Motion) we here at Exokit see a huge need for fast, easy to develop and use, web based needs. We aren't trying to be a normal browser, we are **made** specifically for delivering the fastest and highest quality web VR/MR/AR experiences and have no intention of changing that goal.
  
  ## What Sites Work?
  
  Well the goal is that we can say, "All of them." As of now however we are chugging our way through getting more VR web experiences running smoothly, as well as VR web apps like Emukit (our Web-VR-Console Emulator). Of course you can always join us on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/avaer), [Discord](https://discord.gg/cf5tfTV), or [Slack](https://exoslack.now.sh/) if you have some specific use case which seems to not work, you could also submit an issue on [Github](https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit),  or better yet submit a PR (we're open source).
  
  ## Give Me the TL;DR
  
We have made and shipped a mixed reality web browser, from scratch, that can run WebVR/XR faster than anything else and a Nintendo64 immersive emulator (Emukit) that runs on top of the Exokit Engine. The challenges we face are not tech related. The team going forward will face stiff competition from people with way more money to throw at acquisition, other platform owners not wanting to play ball and rejecting us, marketing resources, and not having enough money to hire developers.
 
 With your help as a user or a developer or even as someone that just hangs out with us in the Twitch chat or Discord, that can all change.
