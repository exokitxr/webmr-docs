# What is Exokit

  Exokit is a browser that is made from the ground-up for performance and ease of access in the post-screen era. 
  
  ## How?
  
  We achieve this by not being based on legacy like Chrome and Firefox, which have slow load times and are difficult to create experiences on. The Exokit browser can run web mixed reality experiences faster than any other browser. We have done this by making the browser from first principles. We didn't start with a 2d browser then slap some half assed VR into it. The team considered what a runtime for VR would look like on a web stack... and then we did that. The Exokit browser is inherently multi-platform as it binds to Vive, Oculus, Leap Motion, Magic Leap, and keyboard/mouse on Windows, OSX, or Linux. The experience is pervasively multiplayer; every experience can be shared. The main interface is "reality tabs", or opening 3D web sites as layers of virtual/augmented reality. The product runs on web content and standards (HTML, WebXR, WebGL, Unity + Unreal exports). 
  
  ## Is She Fast?
  
  Exokit is the fastest on the market (2-3x faster than Chrome or Firefox) in performance and to adapting to the extremely fast pace of change in the world of mixed reality.  
  
  ## Bang For Your Buck
  
  Users get the benfits of free, persistent, multi-user content experience on the web at a low switching cost with plenty of entertainment and social opportunities. Developers of the platform get value from costless customer outreach to very large engine/device matrix with ease of integration (Unity, Unreal, web) with standard web APIs and future planned hosting products and payments platform. 

  ## Give Me the TL;DR
  
We have made and shipped a mixed reality web browser, from scratch, that can run WebVR/XR faster than anything else and a nintendo64 immersive emulator (Emukit) that runs on top of the Exokit browser. The challenges we face are not tech related. The team going forward will face stiff competition from people with way more money to throw at acquisition, other platform owners not wanting to play ball and rejecting us, marketing resources, and not having enough money to hire developers. But with your help as a user or a developer or even as someone that just hangs out with us in the twitch chat or discord, that can all change.
