1. `git clone https://github.com/webmixedreality/exokit.git`

2. Run the downloaded file, and be sure to allow any security clearance the installer might need. 
	* (For Linux: `apt-get install build-essential wget python libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev uuid-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libasound2-dev libexpat1-dev`)

3. Then let the installer work its magic for a minute or so and congratulations you're (almost) a proud user of Exokit!
	* For Windows Users: 
		* Choose your desired folder location (note: if not installing into your main drive then you may have to go into the folder yourself after downloading and find the file 'exokit.cmd')
	* For OSX Users: 
		* A window should open with the Exokit app file and your applications folder, simply drag Exokit into that folder.
	* For Linux Users: 
If you used the install script all of the above should be in /usr/lib (which is probably in your PATH). 

4. Run `exokit`
