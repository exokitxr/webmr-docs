# Reality Tabs

### Reality Tabs are a new way to think about distributing and consuming VR/AR content.

Exokit Browser offers the technology to hot swap through VR/AR experiences on the fly.<br>

## Reality tabs ~= Web Browser Tabs... but for VR/AR

It is basically the same user experience as using a normal web browser that we are all used
to. Reality Tabs are akin to normal browser tabs, except that you are truly in the tab.

You can create your own Reality Tab easily by hosting your VR/AR web app on a valid domain. Exokit Browser handles the rendering of the Reality Tab and brings it into the users view for you.

Maybe a small tutorial?

## Details for Devs:

What can the dev use to create reality tabs?

These are some popular ways people are creating VR/AR experiences on the web:

# 3D with Javascript

### I thought this could be a creative moment for avaer or someone to talk about the basics of doing VR/AR 3D programming realted to Exokit Browser in some way.. maybe some math or basic libs used or topics, etc. Make it related to doing 3D with JS as this is a cool point for us.
